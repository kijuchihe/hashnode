If you are like me: who wants to be a very good backend developer, I'm pretty sure the thought of making your app more secure, reliable, faster and more efficient. This was the same situation I found myself, I was looking for ways to do just that! Then, I came across the idea of rate limiting and using JOI for authentication.

I thought to myself, "Ahaa, rate limiting will make my app more secure". Then I carried the load of going to study it (being dramatic). Eventually, I came across some videos and articles and to be very honest I was so confused with some of the algorithms.

## Problems

* Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests and abuse
    
* Strengthen authentication security to protect user data.
    

## Solutions

* Since I couldn't implement the algorithm myself, I just went with a package called `express-rate-limiter`. Pretty easy to setup because of the amount of abstraction and encapsulation that has been done.
    
* I also learned to use JOI for more security and easier handling of errors (in the long run).
    

I don't really have much to say about these. You can checkout this article on \[Cloud Fare\]([https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limitin](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limitin)g) to find out more

## HNG Internship

As I start my HNG Internship, I'm excited to dive deeper into mobile development. My goal is to gain hands-on experience, learn from building difficult projects and tasks, and build a portfolio that showcases my skills. I aim to become a proficient mobile developer, creating scalable and maintainable applications that delight users.

The HNG Internship offers the perfect opportunity to learn, collaborate with peers, work on real-world projects and grow (something I am very particular about).
