Hello guys, I'm here with another article. In this article, I will be talking about mobile development platforms and software architecture patterns that shape the industry of mobile development.

This article: although my solution to an assignment on HNG internship program; will highlight why I genuinely like the HNG internship and am eager to start.

## Mobile Development Tools and Platforms

When building mobile apps, you could either use native tools specific for a particular platform (like Android or IOS) or you could use cross-platform tools like React Native \[which I use by the way ;-) don't judge\] to make apps for both the major platforms.

Here is a better explanation of what was just said above

1. Native iOS (Swift, Objective-C) and Android (Java, Kotlin) development offer optimal performance and access to platform-specific features. However, this approach requires separate code-bases and expertise.
    
2. Cross-platform frameworks like React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin enable code reuse and faster development. While they may compromise on performance, they offer a unified code-base and easier maintenance.
    

## Software Architecture Patterns:

If you have been programming, you should have come across this at least once. If you're like me, you'll want to find out even more about how to make your code shorter, faster, more reusable, cleaner and so on.

Here are some architectural patterns

1. MVC (Model-View-Controller): A popular pattern that separates concerns, making it easy to manage complexity. However, it can lead to tight coupling and overhead.
    
2. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): An extension of MVC, it adds an extra layer for data binding and business logic. This pattern promotes separation of concerns and testability.
    
3. Clean Architecture: A modular approach that prioritizes business logic and separates it from the presentation layer. It promotes scalability and maintainability but can be over-engineered.
    

When I started learning how to code, I learned that you should make your code work before trying to beautify it or shorten it. Also, as you grow as a programmer, you will find yourself writing better code. We often hear the quote "Practice makes perfect".

## HNG Internship

As I start my HNG Internship, I'm excited to dive deeper into mobile development. My goal is to gain hands-on experience, learn from building difficult projects and tasks, and build a portfolio that showcases my skills. I aim to become a proficient mobile developer, creating scalable and maintainable applications that delight users.

The HNG Internship offers the perfect opportunity to learn, collaborate with peers, work on real-world projects and grow (something I am very particular about).
